Ë˜CASE REPORT Ë˜
Donepezil-Induced Adverse Side Effects of Cardiac Rhythm:
2 Cases Report of Atrioventricular Block
and Torsade de Pointes
Atsushi Tanaka, Shoichi Koga and Yoshihiro Hiramatsu
Abstract
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChIs) are widely used in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimerâ€™s
disease (AD), but their cholinergic effects could generate adverse side effects in the cardiovascular system.This report presents the cases of 2 patients who experienced adverse side effects of cardiac rhythm with QTprolongation caused by Donepezil. Both of them improve d to the original rhythm and shortened QT intervals
after the discontinuation of Donepezil.
The present cases suggest that the cholinergic effects of Donepezil could induce adverse side effects on
cardiac rhythm and careful consideration is needed for the patients treated by Donepezil.

Introduction
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChIs) are widely used in
the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD)(1, 2). AChIs are well tolerated and the side effects are basi-cally cholinergic dependent (3, 4). The cholinergic adverseeffects, include gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., nausea, vom-iting, diarrhea and anorexia) predominate. The patients re-ceiving AChIs rarely develop serious disorders of the cardio-vascular system such as syncope, bradycardia, atrioventricu-lar block and QT prolongation (3). However, non-cardiacdrugs can affect the cardiovascular system. QT prolongationmay possibly lead to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias(i.e: torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation). This reportpresents 2 cases in which patients experienced transient car-diac rhythm disorders, associated with Donepezil. The disor-ders disappeared after discontinuing Donepezil.Case Report
Case 1
A 90-year-old man presented with accidental bradycardia.
The patient had no history of the cardiovascular disease andsyncope. The patient had been treated with Donepezil forAlzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) for many years. The daily dose ofthe drug was 5 mg, but it had been increased to 10 mg 3days earlier because of his deteriorating mental state.
The patient was alert and asy mptomatic, but not coopera-
tive. His body temperature was 36.0 Ë†; blood pressure was
158/49 mmHg; and heart rate was 36 beats/minute. Thephysical and neurological findings, chest x-ray, and labora-tory screening test were unremarkable. A transthoracic echo-cardiography revealed normal left ventricular wall motionand ejection fraction. ECG demonstrated an advancedatrioventricular block (2:1 block) and a complete right bun-dle branch block with negative T-waves in leads I, II,
aVL
and V2-6. Marked QT prolongation (QT 0.514 sec) was alsoobserved (Fig. 1).

V2-6 with QT prolongation (QT 0.514 sec).
Figure 2.  ECG showed sinus rhythm, but a 1st degree atrioventricular block (PQ 0.220 sec) and 
the negative T-waves in the same leads and QT prolongation (QT 0.536 sec; QTc 0.538) persisted 
(A). On the 5th day the negative T-waves disappeared and the QT interval decreased to QT 0.450 
sec; QTc 0.456 (B).
We considered that the latest increase of Donepezil may
have contributed to the atrioventricular block, and continu-ing the drug could worsen the arrhythmia. Therefore the
daily Donepezil was discontinued and Orciprenaline at adosage of 30 mg/daily, which has a Î²stimulating effect, was
instead administered.
The following day, ECG showed sinus rhythm, but the 1st
degree atrioventricular block (PQ 0.220 sec) and QT prolon-gation (QT 0.536 sec; QTc 0.538) remained. Orciprenalinewas continued. The ECG on the 5th day showed that the QTinterval was shortened to QT 0.450 sec and QTc 0.456(Fig. 2). As a result, Orciprenaline was stopped, and he re-mained asymptomatic and no significant arrhythmia oc-curred thereafter for 2 months.Case 2
An 87-year-old woman, with a long-term history of hy-
pertension, chronic atrial fibrillation and AD, was diagnosedto have bradycardia (heart rate 40 beats/minute) at anotherclinic. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation and negative T-waves in leads V1-2 and biphasic T-waves in leads V3-6with QT prolongation (QT 0.570 sec; QTc 0.461). Becauseshe experienced neither syncope nor heart failure, she wasadministered 100 mg/daily of Cilostazole in addition to herdaily drugs (Amlodipine 5 mg, Spironolactone 25 mg, War-farin 1 mg and Donepezil 5 mg). After a month, she wasadmitted to the department of orthopedics because of a tho-racic vertebral fracture caused by sudden fall due to tran-

sient syncope.
On admission she had become alert and complained of
back pain. Her body temperature was 36.4 Ë†; blood pressure
was 115/63 mmHg; and heart rate was 40 beats/minute. Thephysical and neurological findings, radiologic examinations,including a computed tomography of the brain, and labora-tory screening test were unremarkable. A transthoracic echo-cardiography revealed normal left ventricular wall motionand ejection fraction. ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillationand the T-wave morphology in the aforementioned leadswith QT prolongation (QT 0.720 sec; QTc 0.594; Fig. 3).
Ten hours after hospitalization, she suddenly complained
of vomiting and nausea. Thirty minutes before that event,the continuous ECG monitoring had revealed torsade depointes followed by R on T and leading to ventricular fibril-lation (Fig. 4). This arrhythmia was sustained for about 3
minutes and recovered to the original rhythm without medi-cation. She was therefore assumed to have fallen because ofAdams-Stokes syndrome due to torsade de pointes. Or-ciprenaline 30 mg/daily was administered in order to preventthe progression of the bradycardia. Furthermore, Donepezilwas discontinued on the 5th day. Her heart rate slightly in-creased to 55 beats/minute, and no adverse ventricular ar-rhythmia was seen. ECG on the 18th day showed disappear-ance of the negative part of the T-waves in leads V3-6 andsignificantly shortened QT intervals (QT 0.490 sec; QTc0.446; Fig. 5). She was discharged on the 37th day, underthe administration of Orciprenaline 30 mg/daily and herusual medications, without the a dministration of Donepezil.

Discussion
The disorders of recognition in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD)
are caused by a decreased function of the central cholinergicnervous system (5). Donepezil is a drug which has inhibi-tory effects on acetylcholinesterase which can improve cog-nitive function in AD and it is widely used in the treatmentof mild-to-moderate AD (1, 2). Donepezil mainly works atthe level of the central nervous system, and causes few pe-ripheral side effects (6, 7). Although its cholinergically-dependent gastrointestinal effects are well recognized, Done-pezil requires careful administration for patients with sinusnode dysfunction or conduction disturbance because of itscholinergic effects. Morganroth et al reported that about30% and 10% of the patients treated with AChIs in Al-zheimerâ€™s disease had cardiovascular disorders and heartrate/rhythm disorders, respectively (8). However, drug-induced bradycardia has rarely been reported and essentiallyoccurs only when the drug is administered in excessivedoses. Therefore, the direct relationship between the routineuse of AChIs and bradyarrhythmia remains controversial andlife-threatening ventricular arrhythmia had also rarely beenreported (6, 9).
Both bradycardia and QT prolongation were observed in
the current cases (case 1: HR36 beats/minute and QT0.514sec, case 2: HR40 beats/minute and QT0.536 sec; QTc0.538). Donepezil had not been used at either in excessivedoses or in combination with other drugs that might effectof QT prolongation. Fortunately, the symptoms improved af-ter discontinuation of Donepezil. Some reports have shownthat the serum potassium level is important to QT prolonga-tion (10, 11). However, the serum potassium concentrationof both patients was 4.4 mEq/L. In both cases it was unclearwhether or not they had conduction disturbances of the heartbefore Donepezil medication, because we did not have anypast ECG taken during without Donepezil medication.
Therefore, we concluded that the observed changes had beeninduced by Donepezil. But there was possibility that Done-pezil worsened their potential conduction disturbances of theheart, because they were extremely old aged. Bordier et alexamined patients with AD who were being treated withDonepezil and experienced syncope, and found a completeatrioventricular block in two cases (12). On the other hand,Fisher et al demonstrated a case with QT prolongation andrecurrent syncope after restarting Galantamine (AChIs) (13).A c c o r d i n gt oa na n a l y s i sb yt h eA u s t r a l i a nA d v e r s eD r u gReaction Advisory Committee (ADRAC), no cases of tor-sade de pointes associated with AChIs were reported, andthe rate of reported adverse effects of Donepezil is 2 timeslower than the rates for other A ChIs (i.e., Galantamine and
Rivastigmine) (13). These side effects may occur more fre-quently than in previous reports, because the patients withAD are often unable to describe symptoms and they couldbe asymptomatic cases such as those seen in the current re-port.
The QT interval is often prolonged by class Ia anti-
arrhythmic drugs. These drugs inhibit the function of therapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (Ikr),coded by the HERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene),which is most frequently affected by drugs inducing QTprolongation (14-17). These QT prolongations are thought tobe a marker of the fatal ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., torsadede pointes, ventricular fibrillation) as in the present lattercase (18-20). QT intervals on the surface ECG show the re-polarization in the M cell zone with the longest action po-tential duration in the myocardium. Some possible factorsinducing specific gene mutations and selective action poten-tial prolongation in this zone may lead to a proarrhythmicstate precipitating the onset of QT prolongation and torsadede pointes (21, 22). This indicates that there are individualspecificities and differences in the sensitivity to the drug,

1223and gene abnormalities are assumed behind these differences
(23, 24). Therefore, the drug effects blocking Ikr could ac-celerate such subclinical genetic features of the ion channelsand thereby lead to the development of QT prolongation.
In conclusion, Donepezil has been widely used in the
treatment of AD and it is well tolerated. However, the po-tential adverse and life-threatening cardiac effects of Done-
pezil should be carefully followed by ECG, because they arecaused by various factors such as diverse underlying drugs,organic heart disease, meta bolic abnormalities and genetic
features.
