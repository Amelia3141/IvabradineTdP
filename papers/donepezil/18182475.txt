Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChIs)
are used in treatment of mild-to-mod-
erate Alzheimer’s disease.1,2These drugs
also improve cognition in patients withother types of dementia, as well as those
with schizophrenia, and may have neuro -
protective properties.
3ACochrane review
concluded that there is no differenceamong AChIs with respect to efficacy.
1
AChIs are well tolerated.1,4Among
cholinergically mediated adverse effects,gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vom-iting, diarrhea, anorexia) predominate.
Patients receiving AChIs rarely develop
potentially serious cardiovascular ad-verse effects such as syncope, bradycar -
dia, atrial arrhythmias, and sinoatrial andatrioventricular block.
5Seventeen cases
of cardiac dysrhythmias associated withdonepezil have been reported.
6Two pa-
tients, one on galantamine7and another
on rivastigmine,8developed prolonged
cardiac repolarization (prolonged QT in -
terval), which may lead to life-threaten -
ing polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias(torsade de pointes).
We report a case in which galantamine
was associated with QT interval prolon-gation, syncope, delirium, vomiting, and
diarrhea. We also searched the Aus-tralian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory
Committee (ADRAC) database for simi-
lar effects related to AChIs.

Author information provided at the end of the text.OBJECTIVE :To describe a case of QT interval prolongation, syncope, and delirium
associated with galantamine use and to analyze similar cases related to
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChIs) reported to the Australian Adverse DrugReaction Advisory Committee (ADRAC).
CASE SUMMARY :An 85-year-old man with dementia was treated with prolonged
release galantamine 8 mg daily for 1.5 years. Three months prior to the currentadmission, he had a syncopal episode with low blood pressure and bradycardia.Two months later ,galantamine was withdrawn, but within 2 weeks, the man
developed marked cognitive, behavioral, and functional deterioration andgalantamine was restarted. Three weeks later, he developed syncope, delirium,hypotension, and prolonged QT interval with serious cardiac arrhythmias, inaddition to vomiting and diarrhea. A complete blood cell count and biochemistrypanel performed on admission were normal. No infection was detected.Galantamine and irbesartan were ceased. The delirium fully resolved in 6 days,and the QT interval shortened from 503 to 443 msec (corrected by Bazett’sformula) 4 days after discontinuation of galantamine and remained normal. 
DISCUSSION :In the ADRAC reports, galantamine was associated with 18 cases of
delirium/confusion, 8 of syncope, 13 of bradycardia, 6 of other arrhythmias orconduction abnormalities, and 6 of hypotension. Donepezil was associated with 56,15, 26, 15, and 5, and rivastigmine with 21, 8, 6, 2, and 2, respectively, of these
reactions. Five fatal outcomes were reported in association with galantamine, 1 1
with donepezil, and 3 with rivastigmine, including 3, 6, and 0 sudden deaths,
respectively. This case, along with previously published reports and casesidentified from the ADRAC database, illustrates that AChIs may lead to delirium,syncope, hypotension, and life-threatening arrhythmias. The Naranjo probabilityscale indicated that galantamine was the probable cause of QT intervalprolongation, syncope, and delirium in this patient.
CONCLUSIONS :Administration of galantamine and other AChIs requires vigilance
and assessment of risk factors that may precipitate QT interval prolongation,
syncope, and delirium.

facial trauma, and lacerations to his forehead, nose, and
right elbow following a fall. Witnesses reported that the
man had loss of consciousness. He was nauseated and hadvomited the previous day and developed weakness, diar-
rhea, and dizziness. He fell getting out of the bed on the
admission day. Three weeks prior to admission he wasrestarted on galantamine prolonged release 8 mg in the
morning after being off the drug for 2 weeks.
About 1.5 years earlier, the patient was diagnosed with
mild dementia of mixed etiology (Alzheimer’s and vascular)and was treated with galantamine 8 mg daily with satisfacto-
ry stabilization for the first 3 months and slow worsening in
the next year. He scored 26 of 30 on the Folstein Mini-Men-
tal State Examination (MMSE) before and 3 months aftertherapy started and 23 nine months later. Three months prior
to the current admission he had a syncopal episode with low
blood pressure (100/80 mm Hg) but without orthostatic hy -
potension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus brady-
cardia of 59 beats/min, with normal PR and QTc intervals
(Table 1
9,10). He was hospitalized, but the cause of syncope
was not identified. Two months later, at a routine check-up,
galantamine was discontinued by his physician because ofthe syncopal episode. Within 2 weeks of galantamine discon -
tinuation, family members noted worsening in cognitive, be-havioral, and functional status. Galantamine was restarted atthe same dose (8 mg daily).
The patient had a history of coronary artery disease, hy-
pertension, hypercholesterolemia, osteoarthritis, hiatus her -
nia, and surgical treatment for benign prostatomegaly. At
the time of presentation, he was also receiving, for morethan 3 years, irbesartan 75 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mgdaily ,simvastatin 20 mg daily, pantoprazole 40 mg daily,
ergocalciferol 1000 IU daily, calcium carbonate 600 mgtwice a day, and acetaminophen 1 g 2 times a day.
On admission, the patient was confused, restless, agitat-
ed, and incontinent of urine. His blood pressure was 84/46mm Hg, pulse 79 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/ min,temperature 36.5
˚C, and room-air oxygen saturation 95%.
He had deep lacerations of his forehead, nose, and right el-
bow and loose front upper teeth, but no focal neurologic
deficit. Complete blood cell count biochemistry, thyroid
function, cardiac troponin I, and C-reactive protein werenormal. No blood, urinary, or fecal infection was detected.
The QTc interval was significantly prolonged regardless
of the formula applied (Table 1). Electrocardiographic 24hour Holter recording on the third admission day showed
sinus rhythm with average heart rate 60 beats/min (mini-
mum 40, maximum 90), frequent multifocal ventricular
ectopics, runs of ventricular beats, ventricular bigeminy and
trigeminy, frequent supraventricular ectopics, aberrantly con-ducted supraventricular run of 10 beats, supraventricular
bigeminy and trigeminy, supraventricular tachycardia, but no
pauses. Echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular
size, mild segmental left ventricular dysfunction, and estimat-ed left ventricular ejection fraction of 51%. 
Computed tomography (CT) of the head did not show
any evidence of acute intracranial bleed or infarct, butthere was prominence of cerebral sulci and the ventriclesin keeping with cerebral atrophy ,and there were old lacu -
nar infarcts. CT of the cervical spine revealed fractures ofthe spinous process of C4, right superior articular processof C3, and left superior articular process of C5. Findings
from chest and abdominal X-rays were unremarkable.
Galantamine and irbesartan were ceased. No other
changes in the patient’ slong-ter mmedications were made.
The patient was treated with a cervical collar, infusion of
NaCl 0.9% (1.5 L/day), prophylactic antibiotics, andthromboembolic prophylaxis (enoxaparin sodium 40 mg
daily). Lacerations were sutured and loose teeth were re-
moved. His delirium resolved over 6 days, but he requiredhaloperidol for agitation (0.25 mg intravenously 6 times in
6days). The QTc interval shortened to 443 msec (by

Australian Reports
Asummary of cases of cardiac, neurologic, and gas-
trointestinal disorders associated with 3 AChIs reported to
ADRAC (to May 31, 2007) is shown in Table 2. No casesof torsade de pointes were reported. There have been 5 fa-tal outcomes associated with galantamine, 1 1with
donepezil, and 3 with rivastigmine, including 3, 6, and 0sudden deaths, respectively. When the number of reported
cases was analyzed per 100,000 prescriptions written, anestimated 8.47 cases of delirium, confusion, or agitation;
3.76 of syncope; 2.82 of any type of arrhythmia or block;3.29 of vomiting; 3.76 of diarrhea; and 1.41 of sudden
death were related to galantamine. For rivastigmine, the
corresponding figures were 14.10, 5.37, 1.30, 7.38, 3.36,and 0, respectively, and for donepezil 4.77, 1.28, 1.27,
2.13, 1.28, and 0.51, respectively. These data suggest thatuse of galantamine may be associated with the highest rateof arrhythmia and sudden death, with rivastigmine having
the highest rate of delirium, syncope, and vomiting; no
sudden death was reported. The rate of reported adverseeffects with donepezil was lower than that with otherAChIs (except that sudden death was not reported withrivastigmine). The total number of reports per 100,000 pre-
scriptions was similar for galantamine and rivastigmine(52.3 and 57.1, respectively) but was about 2 times lower
for donepezil (25.9).
Discussion
Although galantamine is widely used in the treatment of
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease and known to bewell tolerated,
11its cholinergically dependent gastrointesti-
nal adverse effects are well recognized and cardiac distur-bances have been reported.
5To our knowledge, this is the
first case report of a patient who developed withdrawalsyndrome and multiple adverse effects when galantaminewas reintroduced.
Galantamine is a reversible, competitive AChI and an
allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Inour case, at least 2 mechanisms of clinical deterioration
warrant discussion. First, galantamine discontinuationcould lead to a withdrawal syndrome similar to that ob-
served with donepezil.
12Within 2 weeks of galantamine
discontinuation, our patient’ scondition deteriorated, with
obvious cognitive, functional, and behavioral decline, andtherefore, the medication was resumed. Since galan-tamine’ shalf-life is about 6 hours,
13complete galantamine
elimination (5 half-lives) will require approximately 30hours, when the effects of sudden withdrawal may appear.Abrupt discontinuation of AChIs should be avoided. 
Second, when galantamine was restarted in our patient,
symptoms and signs of cholinergic excess (“toxicity”) de -
veloped. These manifested as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

weakness, delirium, syncope, hypotension, tachypnea, QTc
interval prolongation, and arrhythmias, indicating overac-
tivity of muscarinic and nicotinic sites of autonomic andsomatic nerves, as well as of the central nervous system.
This may be due to a significant upregulation of acetyl-
choline receptors caused by decreased synaptic concentra-tion of acetylcholine due to abrupt discontinuation of
galantamine after prolonged exposure to the drug. 
Other causes for clinical deterioration were excluded.
There was no metabolic abnormality, electrolyte imbal-
ance, or signs of infection. Galantamine is the most likelycause, given that it was the only medication recentlyrestarted. The patient’s condition resolved with discontinu-ation of galantamine and irbesartan. The latter may con-tribute to hypotension but is unlikely to cause delirium, syn-cope, QTc interval prolongation, or arrhythmia (MEDLINEsearched). Drug interaction is a theoretical possibility, as
galantamine, irbesartan, and simvastatin undergo metabo-
lism via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. However, the role of thisenzyme in metabolism of irbesartan is minimal,
14and sim-
vastatin was not ceased. Therefore, this mechanism is notlikely to be significant.
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which were seen in our
patient, are the most common adverse effects of AChIslinked to muscarinic enhancement. Urinary incontinence,hypotension, and bradycardia were other muscarinic ef-fects in our case. Weakness, tachypnea, initial “normal”heart rate (followed by bradycardia) may be considered asmainly peripheral nicotinic effects, while CNS effects in-cluded delirium, restlessness, and agitation. There are fewcase reports of delirium,
15syncope,16and QTc interval pro-
longation7associated with galantamine, and the mecha-
nisms of these adverse effects remain unclear.
Although exposure to anticholinergic medications is as-
sociated with delirium,17and galantamine has been shown
to produce effective reversal of this syndrome,18in our pa-
tient, galantamine precipitated agitated delirium. Irre-
versible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by or ganophos-
phorous insecticides causes confusion and coma.19Acase
report described a 77-year-old man with early Alzheimer’s
disease who developed paranoid delusion after 4 days ofgalantamine use.
15
All 3 AChIs used in Alzheimer’s disease, according to a
recent Cochrane review of pooled data from randomized
controlled trials, have demonstrated a significantly higher
incidence of syncope compared with placebo (3.4% vs1.87%).
1An AChI edrophonium has been used as a
provocative agent for inducing syncope during head-uptilt-table testing.
20In the majority of published studies, syn-
cope was associated with donepezil and was usually due to
new- onset bradycardia. However ,in two-thirds of 16 pa -
tients treated with donepezil and hospitalized for evalua-tion of syncope, its cause was considered unrelated to
donepezil.
21There is one case report of syncope due tocomplete atrioventricular block that occurred after the first
administration of galantamine.16
In our patient, the first syncopal episode was observed
14 months after he started galantamine and was associated
with hypotension and sinus bradycardia. The next synco-pal episode occurred 3 weeks after galantamine wasrestarted and was associated with severe hypotension, QTc
interval prolongation, and arrhythmias. Although our pa-
tient had coronary artery disease, he developed syncopeonly when he received galantamine. 
The most extraordinary feature of our case is the
marked QTc interval prolongation with potentially seriouscardiac arrhythmias. Our patient had a QTc interval of 503msec (by Bazett’s formula), an increase of more than 60msec above the drug-free period. According to the Foodand Drug Administration and the Committee for Propri-etary Medicinal Products, any QTc interval over 500 msecor any increase of more than 60 msec is a cause for con-cern for the development of torsade de pointes. In 92% of116 torsade de pointes cases related to treatment with non-cardiac drugs, QTc intervals were more than 500 msec.
22
Acquired or congenital QTc interval prolongation can resultin ventricular arrhythmias leading to syncope, seizures, andsudden death. The Cochrane review of pooled data fromunpublished studies found that use of galantamine was as-
sociated with a significantly higher rate of unexplained
death.
11There has been one report of galantamine-associat-
ed QT cinterval prolongation (518 msec) in a 47-year-old
schizophrenia patient.7Another report described a 78-year-
old man with Alzheimer’s dementia who developed a QTcinterval of 477 msec a week after commencement of ri-
vastigmine.
8Our patient did not have the confounding fac-
tors present in these 2 cases: use of psychotropic drugs in
the first and hypokalemia in the second. He did not receiveany other drugs that may precipitate QTc interval prolon-gation and did not have electrolyte abnormalities or hy-pothyroidism. In our patient, QTc interval prolongationwas associated with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia
revealed by Holter monitoring 3 days after galantamine
was discontinued. Three weeks later, Holter recording wasunremarkable. In our case, polymorphic ventricular tachy -
cardia (torsade de pointes) could not be ruled out, giventhat there was no ECG monitoring during the first days af -
ter admission. 
After organophosphate poisoning, QTc interval prolon-
gation with ventricular arrhythmias, including torsade depointes, often occurs between the third and fifteenth day. Itis unrelated to serum electrolyte imbalance and is associat -
ed with high mortality, especially sudden and unexpecteddeath.
19The syncope experienced by our patient may well
be related to QT cinterval prolongation with dysrhythmia
of torsade de pointes.
Although our patient had no family history of long QT
interval syndrome or sudden cardiac death, a genetic car-Prolonged QT Interval, Syncope, and Delirium with Galantamine

diac channelopathy could not be excluded. A silent muta-
tion may predispose to QTc interval prolongation, whichmanifests only after exposure to a specific drug and/or oth-
er risk factors.
22Increased vagal tone due to the increased
amount of acetylcholine in the synapses is the most likely
explanation for QTc interval prolongation and arrhythmiaswith AChIs. In a canine model, vagal nerve stimulation pro-
longed the QT interval by 1 msec for each 0.82 msec prolon-gation of effective refractory period.
23Data from studies per-
formed by pharmaceutical companies did not show statisti-
cally significant difference between galantamine- (orrivastigmine-) and placebo-treated patients with respect to
QTc, PR, RR, and QRS intervals.
24Our observation and oth-
er case reports are therefore important for postmarketing
safety surveillance. The full spectrum of adverse effects ofAChIs manifests only when a large number of patients withdifferent comorbidities not present in the original trials are
treated. The Naranjo probability scale indicates that in our
patient, galantamine was the probable cause of QT cinterval
prolongation, syncope, and delirium because these reactionshave been previously reported, the events appeared aftergalantamine was readministered and improved after removalof the drug, no alternative causes were identified, and the re -
actions were confirmed by objective evidence.
25
Spontaneously reported adverse drug events are impor -
tant means of postmarketing surveillance, especially whenthe events are rare. Analysis of the ADRAC database re -
vealed that, in addition to well-known gastrointestinal ef-fects, use of AChIs carries the risk of delirium, syncope,arrhythmias, other cardiovascular disturbances, and suddendeath. Clearly, the reporting rates are not synonymous withincidence rates. Despite obvious limitations of sponta-
neous adverse event reporting (underreporting, missing
clinical information, failure to identify comorbid condi-tions), this information should not be ignored. Galan-tamine had the highest rates of reported arrhythmias and
sudden death in comparison with 2 other AChIs, while
rivastigmine demonstrated the highest rates of delirium
and syncope. As the total number of reports for each of
these 2 newer drugs is about 2 times higher than the ratesfor donepezil, some reporting bias could not be excluded. 
Conclusions
Our case, along with previously published reports and
cases identified from the ADRAC database, illustrates that,
in addition to gastrointestinal adverse symptoms, AChIs
may lead to delirium, syncope, and prolongation of QTc
interval, thereby increasing the risk of life-threatening ar-rhythmias. Such adverse effects may appear simultaneous-
ly after galantamine readministration, as in our patient. Ad -
ministering, discontinuing, and restarting AChIs require
vigilance and careful assessment of risk factors that may
precipitate such events.Alexander A Fisher MD FRACP PhD Doc Med Sci, Associate Pro-

EXTRACT O
OBJETIV OS:Describir un caso de prolongación del intervalo QT ,síncope,
ydelirio asociado al uso de la galantamina, y analizar casos similares
reportados al Comité Consejero de Reacciones Adversas a Medicamentos
Australiano, con el uso de los inhibidores de la acetilcolinesterasa.
RESUMEN DEL CASO: Un paciente de 85 años de edad con historia de
demencia leve de etiología mixta (Alzheimer y vascular) había estadorecibiendo galantamina de liberación prolongada en dosis de 8 mg
diarios por un año y medio. Tres meses antes de su admisión a la sala de
emer gencia, el paciente había tenido un episodio de síncope con baja de
presión arterial y bradicardia. Dos meses más tarde, la galantamina fue
suspendida pero en el transcurso de 2 semanas, el paciente presentó
marcado deterioro cognitivo, de comportamiento, y funcional por lo que
la galantamina fue recetada de nuevo al paciente. Tres semanas mástarde, el paciente desarrolló síncope, delirio, hipotensión, prolongación
del intervalo QT con arritmias cardíacas serias, además de vómito y
diarrea. Su contaje sanguíneo y bioquímico era normal y no habíaindicio de infección. La galantamina y el irbesartan fueron suspendidos.
En 6 días su delirio se resolvió completamente, y en 4 días el intervalo
QT se acortó de 503 –443 milisegundos (corregido con la fórmula de
Bazett), y permaneció en un valor normal desde entonces.
REPORTES AUSTRALIANOS: La galantamina estuvo asociada a 18 casos de
delirio/confusión, 8 de síncope, 13 de bradicardia, 6 de otro tipo de
arritmias o anormalidades en la conducción, y 6 de hipotensión. El
donezil estudo asociado a 56, 15, 26, 15, y 5 casos, y la rivastigmina a
21, 8, 6, 2, y 2 casos, respectivamente. Cinco de los casos reportadoscon la galantamina fueron fatales, 11 con el donepezil, y 3 con la
rivastsigmina, incluyendo 3, 6, y 0 casos de muerte repentina,
respectivamente.
DISCUSIÓN: Este caso junto con otros reportados previamente y los
identificados mediante la base de datos australiana ilustran que losinhibidores de la acetilcolinesterasa pueden conllevar a delirio, síncope,hipotensión, y arritmias serias. La escala de probabilidad Naranjo indicó
que la galantamina era probablemente responsable por la prolongación
del intervalo QT, síncope, y delirio en este paciente.CONCLUSIONES: Laadministración de la galantamina y otros inhibidores
de la acetilcolinesterasa requieren de la vigilancia y evaluación defactores de riesgo que puedan precipitar una prolongación del intervalo
QT, síncope, y delirio.

Prise de Galantamine

RÉSUMÉ
OBJECTIF: Décrire un cas de prolongation de l’intervalle QT, de syncope,
et de delirium liés à la prise de galantamine et comparer à d’autres cas
rapportés au Comité australien d’effets indésirables des médicamentsconcernant les inhibiteurs de l’acétylcholinestérase (AchE). 
SOMMAIRE DU CAS: Un homme de 85 ans souffrant de démence a été
traité par la galantamine à libération prolongée à raison de 8 mg par jourpendant 18 mois. Trois mois avant la présente hospitalisation, il a
présenté un épisode de syncope avec hypotension et bradycardie. Deux
mois plus tard, la galantamine a été cessée mais en moins de 2 semaines,
le patient a présenté une détérioration marquée au niveau fonctionnel,
comportemental, et cognitif ; la galantamine a donc été réintroduite.
Trois semaines suite à la réintroduction de la galantamine, le patient afait une syncope avec hypotension, un delirium, une prolongation de
l’intervalle QT, et de graves arythmies cardiaques en plus de
vomissements et de diarrhée. À l’admission, la formule sanguine et tous
les tests de biochimie étaient normaux. Aucune infection n’a étédétectée. La galantamine ainsi que l’irbésartan ont été cessés. Le
delirium est complètement disparu après 6 jours et l’intervalle QT estpassé de 503 –443 millisecondes (corrigé selon la formule de Bazett) 4
jours après l’arrêt de la galantamine et est demeuré normal par la suite.La galantamine a été associée à 18 cas de delirium ou de confusion, 8
casde syncope, 13 cas de bradycardie, 6 cas d’arythmies ou de troubles
de conduction, et 6 cas d’hypotension. Le donépézil a, quant à lui, été
associé respectivement à 56, 15, 26, 15, et 5 cas tandis que la
rivastigmine l’a été dans 21, 8, 6, 2, et 2 cas respectivement. Cinq cas dedécès ont été rapportés avec la galantamine, 11 avec le donépézil, et 3
avec la rivastigmine, incluant 3, 6, et 0 morts soudaines respectivement. 
DISCUSSION: Ce cas, en plus des cas précédemment publiés et de ceux
rapportés dans le cadre du programme australien de déclaration des
effets indésirables des médicaments, montre que les inhibiteurs de
l’AchE peuvent provoquer un delirium, une syncope, de l’hypotension,et des arythmies potentiellement mortelles. L’échelle de probabilité de
Naranjo montre que la galantamine était la cause probable de la
prolongation de l’intervalle QT, de la syncope, et du delirium observés
chez ce patient. 
CONCLUSIONS: La prise de galantamine et d’autres inhibiteurs de
l’acétylcholinestérase doit être suivie rigoureusement et une évaluationdes facteurs de risque pouvant précipiter une prolongation de l’intervalle
QT, une syncope, ou un delirium doit être faite.
