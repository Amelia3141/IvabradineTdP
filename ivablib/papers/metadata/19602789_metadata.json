  "title": "Donepezil-induced adverse side effects of cardiac rhythm: 2 cases report of atrioventricular block and Torsade de Pointes.",
  "abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChIs) are widely used in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their cholinergic effects could generate adverse side effects in the cardiovascular system. This report presents the cases of 2 patients who experienced adverse side effects of cardiac rhythm with QT prolongation caused by Donepezil. Both of them improved to the original rhythm and shortened QT intervals after the discontinuation of Donepezil. The present cases suggest that the cholinergic effects of Donepezil could induce adverse side effects on cardiac rhythm and careful consideration is needed for the patients treated by Donepezil.",
