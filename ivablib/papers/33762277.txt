SUMMARY
Hydroxychloroquine has been widely prescribed to treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A 73-
 year
-
 0ld 
woman with CO
VID-19 pneumonia was treated with 
dexamethasone and hydroxychloroquine. Her home medications, citalopram and donepezil, were continued. The ECG prior to starting hydroxychloroquine showed normal sinus rhythm with prolonged corrected QT (QTc) of 497 ms, due to citalopram and donepezil therapy. Repeat ECG on days 3 and 4 of hydroxychloroquine therapy showed significantly prolonged QTc of 557 ms and 538 ms, respectively, despite normal serum electrolytes. All QT-
 prolonging medications 
including hydro
xychloroquine were discontinued on 
day 4; however, she suffered a transient torsades de pointes lasting for about 15 s, which resolved before any intervention. QTc improved to 477 ms, after discontinuation of QT-
 prolonging medications
. The 
patient had QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes due to therapy with multiple QT-
 prolonging medications
. 
Medicine reconciliation and careful monitoring of QTc may help prevent cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine.
BACKGROUND
Hydroxychloroquine is a safe and well-  tolerated 
medication, used in the management of malaria 
and connective tissue disorders 
including rheu-
matoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythema-tosus for decades.
1 Hydroxychloroquine has been 
widely prescribed in the past few months to treat patients with COVID-19 disease due to its anti-
 
inflammatory and antiviral prop
erties, especially 
after Gautret et al2 showed significant reduction in 
SARS-
 CoV
-2 viral load with hydroxychloroquine 
therapy. The antiviral effect of hydroxychloroquine was proposed to be further reinforced by adding azithromycin to the regimen.
2 We report an inter -
esting case of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and torsades de pointes in a patient with SARS-
 CoV
-2 
(COVID-19) pneumonia, provoked by therapy with multiple QTc-
 prolonging medications.
CASE PRESENTATION
A 73-  year -  old woman with a medical history 
of diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidaemia, dementia, depression and gastro-
 oesophageal 
reflux disease was sent to the emergency 
room (ER) 
from an assisted living facility with fever 101.7°F and rhinorrhoea for 2 days. The patient was noted to be restless with intermittent agitation in the ER. On initial evaluation in the ER, she was febrile with temperature 100.2°F and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 89/53 mm Hg. Oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. She responded appropriately to fluid resuscitation with an improved blood pressure of 143/65 mm Hg after administration of 2 L 0.9% normal saline. Otherwise, the physical examination was unremarkable.
INVESTIGATIONS
Pertinent laboratory work-  up revealed leucopenia 
(white cell count 2.94×109/L), lymphopenia (abso-
lute lymphocyte count 0.71×109/L), mild throm-
bocytopenia (platelet count 108×109/L), elevated 
lactate (2.5 mmol/L), elevated blood glucose (185 mg/dL), elevated C reactive protein (19.5 mg/L), normal troponin I, normal renal and liver tests, and a negative influenza A and B test. Chest radio-graph showed few bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, suspicious for COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 was obtained and she was admitted to the hospital with sepsis and acute hypoxic respi-ratory failure requiring oxygen supplementation at 2–3 L/min via nasal cannula. The patient’s home medications, including citalopram 20 mg daily, donepezil 10 mg daily and gabapentin 300 mg three times per day, were continued. The ECG prior to starting hydroxychloroquine showed normal sinus rhythm with a prolonged QTc of 497 ms (figure
 
1), 
due to citalopram and donepezil therapy. Coro-navirus SARS-
 CoV
-2 (COVID-19) test came back 
positive and she was started on dexamethasone and hydroxychloroquine monotherapy for 5 days (800 mg for 1 day followed by 400 mg for 4 days). Azith-romycin was not started due to prolonged QTc. Her medical condition continued to decline with wors-ening hypoxia requiring medical intensive care unit admission. She initially required oxygen supple-mentation via non-
 rebreather and high-
 flow nasal 
o
xygen, followed by endotracheal intubation and 
mechanical ventilation. She required fentanyl and propofol infusions for sedation. Echocardiogram revealed normal left and right ventricular function. Repeat ECG on days 3 and 4 of hydroxychloroquine therapy showed significantly prolonged QTc of 557 ms and 538 ms (figure
 
2), respectively. Electrolytes 
including potassium, magnesium and calcium were normal. All QTc-
 prolonging 
medications including copyright. on August 11, 2021 at India:BMJ-PG Sponsored. Protected by http://casereports.bmj.com/ BMJ Case Rep: first published as 10.1136/bcr-2020-239963 on 24 March 2021. Downloaded from

hydroxychloroquine were discontinued on day 4, however the 
patient suffered a transient torsades de pointes lasting for about 15 s, which resolved spontaneously before any intervention. She had QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes, provoked by multiple QT-
 prolonging 
medications including citalopram, 
donepezil, propofol and hydroxychloroquine. QTc improved to 477 ms (figure
 3
) after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine 
and other QT-
 prolonging medications. 
Remdesevir was not 
available at that time for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.
TREATMENT
QTc improved to 477 ms after discontinuation of hydroxychlo-roquine and other QT-
 prolonging 
medications. QTc was moni-
tored closely with daily ECG. Serum electrolytes were closely monitored and repleted as appropriate.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The patient’s intensive care unit course was complicated by prolonged respiratory failure, methicillin-
 resistant 
Staphylo-
coccus aureus pneumonia, metabolic encephalopathy, right lower extremity deep venous thrombus and upper gastroin-testinal bleed. She did not have any recurrence of torsades de pointes or any other ventricular arrhythmia. Unfortunately, she was transitioned to comfort care on day 18 of the intensive care unit stay after a failed extubation.
DISCUSSION
Hydroxychloroquine can cause acute and chronic toxicity. Potential adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine include gastro-intestinal disturbance, skin photosensitivity, retinopathy, cardiac toxicity, hypoglycaemia, neuropsychiatric effects including agitation, confusion and psychosis, and haemolysis, especially in patients with glucose-6-
 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
.3 4
Cardiac complications from hydroxychloroquine are rare but 
can be severe and life-
 threatening. Hydro
xychloroquine-
 related 
cardiac 
adverse effects are conduction abnormalities, ventricular 
hypertrophy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pulmo-nary arterial hypertension and valvular dysfunction.
5 6 Various 
cardiac conduction abnormalities include first-
 degree atrioven
-
tricular block, second-
 degree atrioventricular block, 
complete 
heart block, prolonged QTc, torsades de pointes and other ventricular arrhythmias.
5 6 Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine-  
associated cardia
c arrhythmia are inherited long QT syndrome, 
ischaemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, history of ventricular arrhythmia, unexplained syncope, family history of premature sudden cardiac death, polypharmacy with QTc-
 prolonging medications, electrolyte 
abnormalities 
(hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia), hepatic and renal failure.
7–9
Hospitalised patients and those with risk factors for 
hydroxychloroquine-
 associated cardiac 
arrhythmia should be 
recommended an ECG before considering hydroxychloroquine therapy, unless they had one within the last 3 months.
8 Patients 
with normal QTc and no risk factors for cardiac toxicity can be treated without delay.
8 9 Patients with slightly prolonged QTc 
≥470 ms (men) or ≥480 ms (women) but QTc <500 ms should be treated with caution; with a repeat ECG in 48 and 96 hours to re-
 
evaluate QTc.8 9 Patients with prolonged QTc ≥500 ms should 
be reassessed after correction of electrolytes and discontinuation of other QT-
 prolonging 
medications.8 9 If QTc persists ≥500 ms, 
evaluation of benefits and risks of therapy and expert consulta-tion may be considered.
8 9 Patients on multiple QTc-  prolon ging 
medications should have a repeat ECG in 48 hours; if QTc increases by ≥60 ms or becomes ≥500 ms, re-
 evaluate 
bene-
fits and risks of therapy.8 9 Citalopram, donepezil and propofol 
have all been associated with QTc prolongation and ventricular

arrhythmia.10–13 Our patient received multiple QTc-  prolonging 
medications including citalopram, 
donepezil and propofol along 
with hydroxychloroquine, which caused significant QTc prolon -
gation and provoked torsades de pointes. Medicine recon-
ciliation and careful monitoring of QTc can prevent cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxy -
chloroquine. The role of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 has been evaluated in various clinical trials and recent studies do not support any clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine therapy in COVID-19.
