Torsades de Pointes Induced by the Concomitant Use of Ivabradine and Azithromycin: An Unexpected Dangerous Interaction Published: 27 August 2014 Volume 15 , pages 104–106, ( 2015 ) Cite this article Cardiovascular Toxicology Aims and scope Submit manuscript Abstract A 68-year-old man had a cardiac syncope. He was known to have a long QT-interval and was treated with ivabradine for paroxysmal sinusal tachycardia. In the last 5 days, azithromycin had been prescribed for sinusitis. An electrocardiogram showed torsades de pointes (TdP). Azithromycin is known to prolong the QT-interval. Ivabradine does not affect the QT-interval but has a conditional risk of TdP when taken with other drugs that block its metabolic breakdown. This case presents the specific problem of a patient with long QT who received two medications, which may interact and prolong the QT.
