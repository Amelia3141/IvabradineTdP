  "title": "Long QT syndrome in a patient with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and auto-immune diabetes: focus on the choice of anti-H1 drugs.",
  "abstract": "The long QT syndrome is a rare disease. The prevalence is estimated at 1/5 000 to 1/20,000. Numerous drugs are contra-indicated because they can lengthen the QT interval. A case of pollen allergy in an adolescent with LQTS is described. The possibility to prescribe anti-H1 drugs is reviewed since cases of torsades de pointe and even deaths have been reported for terfenadine and astemizole. Diphenhydramine, orphenadrine and hydroxyzine are contra-indicated. No accidents and no effects on the QT interval have been published for ebastine, fexofenadine, desloratadine and levocetirizine. These anti-H1 drugs could be used with great care, without any association with drugs resulting in low serum potassium level. Azelastine eye drops have been authorized and a routine protection by inhaled corticosteroids during the pollinic period has been advised in this adolescent treated by betablockers.",
