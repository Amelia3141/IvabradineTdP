Veltman, MDa,b, Georgette E. Hoogslag, MSca, Rohit K. Kharbanda, MSca,\nMichiel A. de Graaf, MSca, Erik W. van Zwet, PhDc, Bas L. van der Hoeven, PhD, MDa,\nVictoria Delgado, PhD, MDa, Jeroen J. Bax, PhD, MDa, and Arthur J.H.A. Scholte, PhD, MDa,*\nThe presence of a left dominant coronary artery system is associated with worse outcome\nafterST-segmentelevationmyocardialinfarction(STEMI)comparedwithrightdominance\nor a balanced coronary artery system. However, the association between coronary arterial\ndominance and left ventricular (LV) function at follow-up after STEMI is unclear. The\npresent study aimed at evaluating the relation between coronary arterial dominance and\nLV ejection fraction (LVEF) shortly after STEMI and at 12-month follow-up. A total of\n741 patients with STEMI (mean age 60 \u2013 11 years and 77% men) were evaluated with\n2-dimentional echocardiography within 48 hours of admission (baseline) and at 12-month\nfollow-up after STEMI. Coronary arterial dominance was assessed on the angiographic\nimages obtained during primary percutaneous coronary intervention. A right, left, and\nbalanced dominant coronary artery system was noted in 640 (86%), 58 (8%), and 43 (6%)\npatients, respectively. At baseline, significant difference in LV function was observed, with\nslightly lower LVEF in patients with a left dominant coronary artery system (LVEF 45 \u2013\n8% vs 48 \u2013 9% and 50 \u2013 9%, for left dominant, right dominant, and balanced coronary\narterysystemrespectively,p[0.03).However,at12-monthfollow-upnodifferencesinLV\nfunction or volumes were observed among the different coronary arterial dominance\ngroups. In conclusion, patients with a left dominant coronary artery system had lower\nLVEF early after STEMI. At 12-month follow-up, differences in LVEF were no longer\npresentamongthedifferentcoronaryarterialdominancegroups. (cid:1)2014ElsevierInc.All\nrights reserved.
