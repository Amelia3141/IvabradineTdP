This is one\nreason why the cardiovascular side effects of medications\nare often unanticipated. Since 2005, new drugs have to\nundergoa\u2018\u2018thoroughQTstudy\u2019\u2019(TQT)[4].However,even\nTQTstudiesmayfailtodetectproarrhythmiceffectsbefore\nmedications are used in clinical practice. Drug-induced\nprolongation of the QTc is a relevant adverse event espe-\ncially in patients with several cardiovascular conditions\nand often under polytherapy. Some drugs are particularly\nimportant because interactions with frequently used medi-\ncations can increase the risk of TdP. One interaction\ninvolves the co-prescription of a medication that prolongs\nthe QTc with another one that increases the plasma con-\ncentration of the first drug (pharmacokinetic interaction).\nAnother interaction involves the co-administration of\nmedications, each with prolonging effects on the QTc\n(pharmacodynamic interaction). Estimating the risk of\ntheseinteractionsisdifficult.Mostofwhatisknownabout\ndrug-induced QTc prolongation derives from reports.\nIt is known that the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin\nmay prolong the QT [5]. Thus, one might assume that in\nthis patient with preexisting long QTc, azithromycin\ninduced TdP and ivabradine was an innocent bystander.\nIvabradine is a selective If-inhibitor and thus reduces\nFig.1 ECG recorded 30min. after the syncope, showing TdP.
