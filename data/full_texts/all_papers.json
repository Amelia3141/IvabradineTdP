Existing rate-control options, including beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and digoxin, are limited by adverse hemodynamic effects and their ability to attain target heart rate (HR). Ivabradine, a novel HR-controlling agent, decreases HR through deceleration of conduction through I(f) ('funny') channels, and is approved for HR reduction in heart failure patients with ejection fraction less than 35% and elevated HR, despite optimal pharmacological treatment. Because I(f) channels were thought to be expressed solely in sinoatrial (SA) nodal tissue, ivabradine was not investigated in heart failure patients with concomitant AF. Subsequent identification of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel 4 (HCN4), the primary gene responsible for I(f) current expression throughout the myocardium, stimulated interest in the potential role of ivabradine for ventricular rate control in AF. Preclinical studies of ivabradine in animal models with induced AF demonstrated a reduction in HR, with no significant worsening of QT interval or mean arterial pressure. Preliminary human data suggest that ivabradine provides HR reduction without associated hemodynamic complications in patients with AF.

By inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine in the central nervous system, donepezil has been shown to slow cognitive decline and improve patients' functional status. While donepezil is well-tolerated and generally considered safe at therapeutic doses, taking more than the prescribed dose could result in adverse cholinergic effects that range from mild gastrointestinal distress to serious cardiac dysrhythmias. We present a case of an 84-year-old man who developed gastrointestinal and cardiac disturbances after ingesting seven-times his daily dose of donepezil.

    "AB": "We used a mobile electrocardiograph to manage the adverse effects and interactions of drugs, especially QT-prolonging drugs, in a community pharmacy setting. We report the case of a patient in whom the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP) was lowered, after monitoring by community pharmacists. CASE: An 80-year-old woman was under donepezil (5 mg/d) therapy for Alzheimer's disease and also taking other drugs that interact with donepezil, namely, benidipine (8 mg/d) and atorvastatin (10 mg/d). The patient was visited almost every month, and an electrocardiogram was usually obtained. QTc prolongation (avg. 470+/-9 ms) was observed in the first to third tests. Her doctor was informed about these results and the risk factors (advanced age, gender, and drugs interactions (benidipine and atorvastatin)) associated with TdP and asked to respond promptly since several cases of donepezil-induced TdP have been reported. As a result, benidipine was replaced with amlodipine, while the remaining drugs were continued. After the change, a significant decrease in QTc values were observed in the fourth to seventh tests (avg. 441+/-9 ms, p=0.010), thereby indicating a decrease in TdP risk. The Drug Interaction Probability Scale (object drug, donepezil; precipitant drug, benidipine) score was +6 (probable). Thus, QTc shortening was a result of differences in donepezil-benidipine and donepezil-amlodipine interactions.",

CASE: An 80-year-old woman was under donepezil (5 mg/d) therapy for Alzheimer's disease and also taking other drugs that interact with donepezil, namely, benidipine (8 mg/d) and atorvastatin (10 mg/d). The patient was visited almost every month, and an electrocardiogram was usually obtained. QTc prolongation (avg. 470+/-9 ms) was observed in the first to third tests. Her doctor was informed about these results and the risk factors (advanced age, gender, and drugs interactions (benidipine and atorvastatin)) associated with TdP and asked to respond promptly since several cases of donepezil-induced TdP have been reported. As a result, benidipine was replaced with amlodipine, while the remaining drugs were continued. After the change, a significant decrease in QTc values were observed in the fourth to seventh tests (avg. 441+/-9 ms, p=0.010), thereby indicating a decrease in TdP risk. The Drug Interaction Probability Scale (object drug, donepezil; precipitant drug, benidipine) score was +6 (probable). Thus, QTc shortening was a result of differences in donepezil-benidipine and donepezil-amlodipine interactions.",
